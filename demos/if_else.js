// Here's a simple exercise for you to practice using an if-else statement:

// Exercise: Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd. If the number is even, print "The number is even." If the number is odd, print "The number is odd."

// Hint: You can use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 2.

var number = 9;

var condition = (number % 2) == 0;

if (condition) {
console.log("The number is even");
} else {
console.log("The number is odd");  
}
